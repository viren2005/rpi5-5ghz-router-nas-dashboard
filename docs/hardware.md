# Hardware Components

## Compute Platform
The Raspberry Pi 5 was selected due to its improved CPU performance,
USB bandwidth, and ability to simultaneously handle routing,
storage, and monitoring workloads.

---

## Wi-Fi Interfaces
External USB Wi-Fi adapters (AWUS036ACM and AWUS036ACS) were used instead of the onboard radio to:
- Enable stable 5 GHz operation
- Support external antennas
- Allow driver-level experimentation


---

## Antennas
Both omnidirectional and directional antennas were used.
Directional testing was performed using a Vivaldi antenna,
enabling focused coverage and propagation experiments.

---

## Storage
An external USB hard drive was used to provide NAS functionality.
The storage subsystem was configured to coexist with routing
and monitoring services without significant performance degradation.
